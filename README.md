Effects of Principal Components on k-Nearest Neighbors Accuracy

PCA - Principal Components and hyper plane in which all features are overlayed to represent it as a single 
line of variance which shows how data varies and what features contribute to percentage of variance in data.

Using this principal components - can imporve to reduce reduce variance and reduce dimensionaility of the data.

Here we use how PCA can be used and how it affects the accuracy of any algorithm (kNN)

Dataset - IRIS - Flower species classification using features of flowers

Conclusion:

Accuracy of k-NN using PCA is 92% same as non PCA k-NN- Part A as the
miss classification which is due to no true decision boundary between classes versicolor
and virginica even after using principal components as a result the flowers of species
virginica is misclassified as versicolor.
